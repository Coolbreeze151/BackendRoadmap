## HTTPS

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP. It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. HTTPS encrypts the data sent between the client and the server, ensuring that sensitive information such as login credentials and payment details are protected from eavesdroppers.

## OWASP Risks

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. OWASP publishes a list of the top 10 security risks for web applications, which includes:

1. Injection
2. Broken Authentication
3. Sensitive Data Exposure
4. XML External Entities (XXE)
5. Broken Access Control
6. Security Misconfiguration
7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure Deserialization
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

## CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. CORS allows servers to specify who can access their resources and how they can be accessed.

## SSL/TLS

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. SSL is the predecessor to TLS. These protocols use encryption to ensure the privacy and data integrity of communications between two systems.

## CSP

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard introduced to prevent a wide range of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. CSP allows web developers to control the resources that a user agent is allowed to load for a given page.

## Server Security

Server security involves protecting the server and its data from unauthorized access and other cyber threats. Key practices include:

- Regularly updating and patching server software
- Using firewalls to block unauthorized access
- Implementing strong authentication mechanisms
- Monitoring server logs for suspicious activity
- Using intrusion detection systems (IDS)
