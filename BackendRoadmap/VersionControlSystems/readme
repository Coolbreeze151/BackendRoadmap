- `git commit -m "<message>"`: Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Push your local commits to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
- `git branch`: List all branches in the repository.
- `git checkout <branch>`: Switch to a different branch.
- `git merge <branch>`: Merge changes from a different branch into the current branch.
- `git status`: Show the current status of the repository.
- `git log`: View the commit history.

For more detailed information and advanced usage, refer to the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

Remember to always commit your changes frequently and use meaningful commit messages. Happy coding!
