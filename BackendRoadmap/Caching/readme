## [Server Side](https://www.naukri.com/code360/library/server-side-caching-and-client-side-caching)

### [Memcached](https://github.com/memcached/memcached#readme)

Memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory caching system that can be used to speed up dynamic web applications by caching data in memory. It is easy to use and can significantly reduce database load.


### [CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/)

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of servers that helps deliver web content to users faster by caching static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files. It can improve website performance and reduce server load.

## [Client Side](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/client-side-caching/)

Client-side caching refers to the caching of data or resources on the user's device, such as in the browser's local storage or cache. It can be used to store frequently accessed data or resources to reduce network requests and improve the user experience.

### [Redis](https://redis.io/)

Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a cache, database, or message broker. It provides advanced data structures and features such as replication, persistence, and pub/sub messaging.
