## API

### [REST](https://dev.to/cassiocappellari/fundamentals-of-rest-api-2nag)
Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- the HTTP.

### [JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/)
JSON API is a specification for building APIs in JSON. It covers how clients should request resources to be fetched or modified, and how servers should respond to those requests.

### [SOAP](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_soap.asp)
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a messaging protocol that allows programs running on disparate operating systems to communicate with each other using HTTP and XML.

### [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data.

## Authentication

### [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure.

### [OAuth](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2)
OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way to grant websites or applications limited access to a user's information without exposing passwords.

### [Basic Authentication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwccHwUn7Gc)
Basic Authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password.

### [Token Authentication](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/what-is-token-based-authentication/)
Token Authentication is a security technique that authenticates users who attempt to access a server. The server issues a token that the client uses to authenticate subsequent requests.

### [Cookie Based Auth](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17769011/how-does-cookie-based-authentication-work/17769061#17769061)
Cookie Based Authentication is a method where the server sends a cookie to the client upon successful login. The client stores this cookie and sends it with every subsequent request to authenticate the user.

### [OpenID](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)
OpenID is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol. It allows users to be authenticated by co-operating sites using a third-party service, eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc login systems.

### [SAML](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-saml/)
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider.
